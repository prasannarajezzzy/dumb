Subject: Request for Firewall Configuration Details

Hi [Recipient's Name],

I am Prasanna from the AI/ML Platform Team at GEICO. We have built a Slackbot called "Gecko-AI" on the geico-sandbox.enterprise.slack.com workspace, which communicates with our backend deployed on an AKS cluster.

To ensure secure communication between the Slackbot and our backend, we need to set up a firewall. For this, we require specific details, including:

Environment: [Specify any environment details if applicable]
Source: [Details about the source]
Server Name: [Details about the backend server]
We have identified some relevant details, which are attached in the accompanying document. Could you please review and confirm whether these configurations are accurate and suitable for our setup?

Thank you for your assistance. Looking forward to your response.

Best regards,
Prasanna
AI/ML Platform Team
