1,What is the purpose of the BOADICEA BC risk model in breast cancer surveillance for women at high risk?,"[""The German Consortium for Hereditary Breast and Ovarian Cancer (GC-HBOC) has successfully implemented risk-adapted breast cancer surveillance for women at high breast cancer risk in Germany.

3,What is the significance of pain prevalence in long-term head and neck cancer survivors?,"['OBJECTIVE: Pain prevalence in long-term head and neck cancer (HNC) survivors is important but understudied to date. The present investigation examined pain prevalence, associated clinical characteristics, and disease-specific health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in a cohort of survivors 10 years postdiagnosis (N\u2009=\u2009187).\nSTUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study.\nSETTING: Single-institution tertiary care center.\nMETHODS: Pain was assessed using a single-item numeric rating scale. Clinical characteristics were abstracted from the patient medical record and HNC-specific HRQOL scores were measured using the Head and Neck Cancer Inventory (HNCI) and are presented by the pain subgroup.\nRESULTS: At 10 years postdiagnosis, 56.7% reported no pain, 20.3% reported mild pain, 16.0% reported moderate pain, and 7.0% reported severe pain. Most patients with moderate or severe pain at the 10-year follow-up assessment also had advanced-stage disease at diagnosis. Multiple linear regression analyses indicated that advanced-stage disease at diagnosis was a significant predictor of pain at 10 years postdiagnosis controlling for age, sex, and comorbidity status (β\u2009=\u2009.184, t\u2009=\u20092.193, P\u2009=\u2009.030, sr\u2009=\u20090.025). Across all HNC-specific HRQOL domains, those reporting moderate/severe pain at 10 years postdiagnosis failed to reach a score of 70 which is indicative of high functioning on the HNCI in the areas of aesthetics, eating, speech, and social disruption.\nCONCLUSION: Pain is a significant issue in long-term HNC survivors up to 10 years postdiagnosis. More research is needed to understand the correlates and types of long-term pain exhibited after treatment, including the implementation of screening and intervention into clinical workflow to improve outcomes and optimize HNC survivorship care.']","Pain prevalence in long-term head and neck cancer survivors is significant as it affects a substantial portion of this population, with 43.3% reporting some level of pain at 10 years postdiagnosis.

14,What role do glucocorticoids and cytokine inhibitors play in the management of cytokine release syndrome (CRS) in patients receiving immune checkpoint inhibitors?,"[""Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have gained widespread application in the treatment of malignant tumors. Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) is a systemic inflammatory response triggered by various factors, including infections and immunotherapy. We present a case of CRS occurring in a gastric cancer patient after receiving combination therapy of tislelizumab, anlotinib and combination of capecitabine and oxaliplatin. Nineteen days after the third dose of tislelizumab, the patient experienced sudden unconsciousness, frothing at the mouth, convulsions and other clinical manifestations resembling epileptiform seizures. Elevated inflammatory markers, cytokine levels and ferritin were markedly increased. Given the absence of definite clinical evidence for metastasis and infection, the diagnosis of CRS was considered. Subsequent management with glucocorticoids and intravenous immunoglobulin resulted in the patient's improvement. However, antitumor therapy was halted, ultimately leading to death. The administration of ICIs can incite CRS, a severe, rapidly progressing condition with a poor prognosis, demanding clinical attention. Cytokines play a dual role in the pathophysiology of immune-related adverse events by mediating self-tolerance attenuation and enhancing the activation of cytotoxic T cells in the antitumor process of ICIs.

Various factors were analyzed to predict ER to treatment. This involved Tg under stimulation (sTg) before RAI, Tg immediately (imTg) 112\u2005h post-RAI and imTg/sTg(rTg). Based on the efficacy of RAI, patients were categorized into two groups: ER and non-ER (NER). Univariate logistic analysis was utilized to compare parameters between the two groups, followed by binary logistic regression analysis on factors associated with ER. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were employed to evaluate the sensitivity, specificity, and optimal diagnostic cutoff points for parameters affecting ER.\nRESULTS: The analysis included 45 ER patients and 56 NER patients. Statistical significance was found in the binary logistic regression analysis for the number of lymph nodes in the lateral cervical region (P\u2005=\u20050.016), sTg (P\u2005=\u20050.021), and rTg (P\u2005≤\u20050.001) concerning ER. ROC curve analysis revealed that the rTg area under the curve was 0.845, with an optimal cutoff value of 11.78, sensitivity of 82.6%, and specificity of 74.5%.\nCONCLUSION: Post-RAI therapy, significant value is demonstrated by rTg with high sensitivity and specificity.

29,"What factors, like lymph nodes and Tg levels, predict ER in DTC post-RAI?","['OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess the usefulness of thyroglobulin (Tg) after radioiodine (RAI) therapy in predicting excellent response (ER) to therapy in postoperative differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC).\nMETHODS: A retrospective observational study was conducted on postoperative DTC patients who underwent RAI from August 2018 to December 2022. Various factors were analyzed to predict ER to treatment. This involved Tg under stimulation (sTg) before RAI, Tg immediately (imTg) 112\u2005h post-RAI and imTg/sTg(rTg). Based on the efficacy of RAI, patients were categorized into two groups: ER and non-ER (NER). Univariate logistic analysis was utilized to compare parameters between the two groups, followed by binary logistic regression analysis on factors associated with ER. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were employed to evaluate the sensitivity, specificity, and optimal diagnostic cutoff points for parameters affecting ER.\nRESULTS: The analysis included 45 ER patients and 56 NER patients. Statistical significance was found in the binary logistic regression analysis for the number of lymph nodes in the lateral cervical region (P\u2005=\u20050.016), sTg (P\u2005=\u20050.021), and rTg (P\u2005≤\u20050.001) concerning ER. ROC curve analysis revealed that the rTg area under the curve was 0.845, with an optimal cutoff value of 11.78, sensitivity of 82.6%, and specificity of 74.5%.\nCONCLUSION: Post-RAI therapy, significant value is demonstrated by rTg with high sensitivity and specificity. This provides a foundation for the evaluation and decisions about DTC treatment in advance.']","Factors that predict excellent response (ER) in differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) post-radioiodine (RAI) therapy include the number of lymph nodes in the lateral cervical region, Tg under stimulation (sTg) before RAI, and the ratio of Tg immediately post-RAI to Tg under stimulation (rTg). Statistical significance was found for these factors in relation to ER.",reasoning,"[{'uid': '39575624', 'Title': 'Predictive value of thyroglobulin after radioiodine therapy for excellent response to treatment in postoperative thyroid cancer.', 'Published': '2024-11-21', 'Copyright Information': 'Copyright © 2024 The Author(s).
