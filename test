I hope this message finds you well. I recently realized that I missed the enrollment deadline for the HSA account due to an oversight. I mistakenly submitted my benefits elections without including the HSA enrollment and would sincerely appreciate any assistance in rectifying this.

Is there any possibility to still enroll in the HSA account for the current benefits period? If any exceptions can be made or if there are additional steps I need to take, please let me know. I would be more than willing to provide any necessary documentation.

Thank you in advance for your understanding and assistance. I truly appreciate your support in this matter.
